Its a Giksel Array Destcriptor algorithm written in Python using OpenCV module. The main goal of the thesis was to create an algorithm for matching multimodal images and do some tests. The descriptor was created based on an article called: "The Gixel Array Descriptor (GAD) for Multi-Modal Image Matching" written by Guan Pang and Urlich Neumann.
